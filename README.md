# Assingment-Multiplayer-Unity
 
Just a couple of notes about the project!

"H" to start the host, "C" to start the client, "K" to start the server"

And a shooting function which allows you to fire bullets by pressing "I"

And I checked files from this repository and you should just Build and Run because it seems to be unable to send my build through repository, other than that nothing else is missing
